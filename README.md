/practicedata/. This is a directory that contains some data you can use for practice.

/sourcedata/. This is a directory that contains data that you'll load to train your models.

/ingesteddata/. This is a directory that will contain the compiled datasets after your ingestion script.

/testdata/. This directory contains data you can use for testing your models.

/models/. This is a directory that will contain ML models that you create for production.

/practicemodels/. This is a directory that will contain ML models that you create as practice.

/production_deployment/. This is a directory that will contain your final, deployed models.



Starter Files
There are many files in the starter: 10 Python scripts, one configuration file, one requirements file, and five datasets.

The following are the Python files that are in the starter files:

training.py, a Python script meant to train an ML model

scoring.py, a Python script meant to score an ML model

deployment.py, a Python script meant to deploy a trained ML model

ingestion.py, a Python script meant to ingest new data

diagnostics.py, a Python script meant to measure model and data diagnostics

reporting.py, a Python script meant to generate reports about model metrics

app.py, a Python script meant to contain API endpoints

wsgi.py, a Python script to help with API deployment

apicalls.py, a Python script meant to call your API endpoints

fullprocess.py, a script meant to determine whether a model needs to be re-deployed, and to call all other Python scripts when needed

The following are the datasets that are included in your starter files. Each of them is fabricated datasets that have information about hypothetical corporations.

Note: these data have been uploaded to your workspace as well

dataset1.csv and dataset2.csv, found in /practicedata/
dataset3.csv and dataset4.csv, found in /sourcedata/
testdata.csv, found in /testdata/
The following are other files that are included in your starter files:

requirements.txt, a text file and records the current versions of all the modules that your scripts use

config.json, a data file that contains names of files that will be used for configuration of your ML Python scripts
